As an Admin I configured Agents' Roles for grouping permissions, Departments for ticket visibility (Help Desk vs SysAdmins, vs Networking), & Teams for pulling agents from different departments.

I then created 2 New Agents, Jane & John Doe. Assigned them to their respective departments, granted them different access, & reset their passwords.

Then back on the Admin Panel, I created 3 New SLA Plans. Sev-A (Grace Period: 1 hour, Schedule: 24/7), Sev-B (Grace Period: 4 hours, Schedule: 24/7), & Sev-C (Grace Period: 8 hours, Business Hours)

<p>
Lastly, I created 5 new Help Topics for when users create a ticket. Business Critical Outage, Personal Computer Issues, Equipment Request, Password Reset, & Other.
